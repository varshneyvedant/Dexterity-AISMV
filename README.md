# Podium - The Winning Live Leaderboard üèÜ

Welcome to Podium, the live, real-time web application that was the winning entry for the Sillico Battles v21.1 inter-school competition. This project was developed and deployed under pressure, with features added on the fly based on the judges' requests. It's a testament to rapid, agile, and effective software development.

This document will guide you through exploring the application, both as a live demo and for those who wish to dive into the code.

## üë®‚Äçüíª For Developers: Running Locally

For those who wish to dive into the code and run the project on their own machine.

### Step 1: Get the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/varshneyvedant/podium-app.git
cd podium-app
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Note: The "Download as PDF" feature requires `wkhtmltopdf` to be installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html).*

### Step 4: Initialize the Database
The first time you run the application, the database needs to be created and seeded with sample data.
```bash
flask init-db
```
This will create a `podium.db` file and populate it with sample schools, events, and a `demo_super_admin` user.

### Step 5: Run the Application
```bash
flask run
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You can log in with the `demo_super_admin` credentials mentioned in the "Live Demo" section.
